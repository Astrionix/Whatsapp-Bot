# Tanglish Bot Accuracy Report
**Average Score:** 7.70/10

| Input | Bot Reply | Score | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Marks vachaya | Ela vachayo, satisfy aithe ledu, expect chesina marks rakapotheye. | 8 | uses colloquial Telugu phrases 'Ela vachayo' and 'satisfy aithe ledu' which are typical of casual conversations in Andhra Pradesh, but uses more direct formal word like 'expect' instead of casual alternative and the phrase 'rakapotheye' seems a bit out of place in Tanglish |
| Photo pettu | Click chesko, post chesta. | 9 | Native-like Tanglish expression with casual tone. |
| Tinnava | Kha, kha. Petaledu. | 8 | Good usage of common colloquialism 'Petaledu', but might sound slightly scripted. |
| Varsham padtunda | Chachchu mowa, varsham padtundira. Umbrella theeskoddi le. | 9 | Native-like usage of colloquial Telugu phrases with moderate English interference. |
| Assignment rasava | Last minute lo cheskovachchu kada, tension ga undi. | 6 | Use of 'Last minute lo' shows familiarity but the structure and vocabulary seem slightly forced. |
| College ki velava | Ema cheppala, classes skip cheste plan chesta. | 8 | Perfect casual Telugu phrases, but slight deviation from typical language structure |
| Photo pettu | Edo kottesar ra, upload chey. | 8 | casual and conversational but slightly more formal than ideal tanglish |
| Bike istava | Fuel ipoyindi le, filling station ki vellava ra. | 6 | uses some colloquialisms like 'ipoyindi' but still somewhat formal and mixes languages, not extremely casual |
| Status chudu | Bore ga undi, em cheyali? | 9 | Bot reply uses native Telugu phrase 'bore ga undi' which is common in everyday conversations and is mixed with English, making it a good example of Tanglish language. |
| Car unda | Drive chesuko, vellipoyava? | 8 | Good use of informal phrase 'vellipoyava' and simple sentence structure, but 'chesuko' could be replaced with 'chesthundhi' |
| Status chudu | Online unna, busy ga unna. | 8 | Natural Tanglish usage, but might seem less authentic for an urgent response with 'unna' twice in one sentence |
| Happy ga undu | Ala ala happy ga undav le, party time ra. | 9 | Good usage of colloquial phrase 'ala ala' and 'party time ra', close to a casual friend's tone. |
| Party eppudu | Weekend lo plan chestha, friday night ga enjoy cheyyali. | 8 | Perfect casual friend usage of 'Weekend lo' and 'cheyyali' but could be more authentic with 'eppudu' in the context |
| Marks vachaya | Superb ra, pass aiyyindi le. | 8 | The use of 'ra' and 'aioyiindi le' gives a casual, colloquial feel. However, the phrase 'Superb' is a bit too formal for Tanglish. |
| Miss you | Nuvvu miss avvabba le, daily call chey mowa. | 9 | The response has a good balance of Tamil (nuvvu, avvabba) and Telugu (le, mowa) vocabulary and structure, making it sound like a casual conversation between friends. The only reason for not giving full marks is that it explicitly mentions a daily call, which might not be typical of an instant, casual response between friends. |
| Naku help kavali | Entha help cheyyali ra, cheppu mowa. | 8 | The response has a good flow in Tanglish and uses colloquial Telugu words, making it relatively close to a natural conversation with a casual friend. |
| Bore kodtundi | Alripira, something chesuko, game adutara le? | 8 | casual, informal and typical of casual conversations between friends, but could be slightly more nuanced for a 10 score. |
| Bayam ga undi | Ayyo, neeku bayam enti, coffee kuditey ra? | 8 | The bot reply is conversational and uses colloquial phrases like 'Ayyo', 'neeku' and 'kudey'. However, a perfectly natural Tanglish response would use more idiomatic expressions and grammatical structures, but still an excellent effort! |
| Food em tinnaru | Biryani tinna le, kotha le? | 8 | Natural phrase with proper use of Telugu words and simple questioning format, however, the tone seems slightly more polite than typical casual conversation |
| Bike istava | Kharidu le, petrol karchu perigi potha. | 9 | Perfect use of casual words and natural flow, only slight hesitation with 'le', would be more natural as 'nu' |
| Status chudu | Adiripoyindi le, idhigo update chey. | 8 | Good effort, but a more casual ending ('adhi, adhigindi') would make it sound more like natural conversation. |
| Happy ga undu | Ala unda le, elanti reason. | 8 | Casual tone, but 'Ala unda le' might be a slightly formal way to say 'Happy ga undu' in informal settings. |
| Sorry | Kshaminchale, no problem ra. | 8 | Simple expression of apology, yet the suffix 'no problem ra' sounds a bit formal for a perfect casual tone. |
| Nidra ravadam ledu | Kavaali, coffee tagestha, oka sip ivvu mowa. | 9 | Perfectly captures casual, informal tone of Tanglish, almost like a friend's response |
| Bagunnava | Bagundam le, chal mowa. | 8 | Response is in casual tone, but 'chal mowa' is more commonly used as a question. It's a great attempt, but could be more perfect. |
| Bore kodtundi | Alage, enti ala bore avthundo, chudu. | 8 | Good mix of colloquial Telugu and informal expressions, but 'ala' in 'enti ala' could be a bit more common usage in casual conversations |
| Bore kodtundi | Alright ala, game adava, movie chudamu le? | 7 | The response is generally natural and authentic, but the sentence structure and vocabulary are slightly more formal compared to native conversational speech. |
| Kotha news enti | Ee roju chala hungama ga undi, corona vaccune matram vacchi release ayindi ra. | 8 | Ee reply more like street talk but a bit formal with 'ra' at the end |
| Dp marchu | Nuvu marchoddu, nijam ra. | 9 | Perfect casual friend - using 'Nuvu' informal you and 'Marchoddu' a suitable replacement for 'Chesanu' |
| Silent ga unnav | Adi emo, tension ga unnav ra. | 9 | Casual use of Telugu phrases in conversation, very natural and authentic Tanglish. |
| Money levu | Paisa ledu, kada loan teyali? | 8 | Perfectly blends into casual Tanglish and uses local slang, but 'teyali' is a bit more formal than 'kodatu'. |
| Party eppudu | This weekend ra, plan chestunna, nuvvu raavocchu kada? | 8 | Perfect casual tone and usage of colloquial words like 'chastunna' and 'raavocchu kada', but slightly less common usage of 'ra' instead of 'i' for 'this' |
| Thanks | Parvaledu, anytimemowa, take care ra! | 2 | Too formal, English usage ('Thanks'). Should be more casual like 'Thanx' or 'Thnku'. |
| Vammo | Po, nenu kuda miss you ra. | 4 | Tanglish authenticity, but slightly too poetic and cliche expression 'kuda miss you ra' |
| Kotha news enti | Emiti, cinema news vachindi, valentine's day ki kotha movie release avtundhi. | 9 | Crisp casual conversation with a mix of Telugu and English, perfectly reflecting the casual style of Tanglish. |
| Bore kodtundi | Alagesthe em cheyyali, movie chudama, le? | 6 | casual, but slightly over-formal phrase choice (e.g., 'movie chudama' can be 'movie cheppa') and usage of question mark |
| Bore kodtundi | Time pass avoddu, movie chudham le. | 6 | Bot reply is in casual tone but uses formal translation for 'Time is passing' |
| Busy na | Kaam lo busy ra, nuvvu. | 8 | Perfect casual Tanglish tone in a single sentence, but not quite as authentic as native users like 'Kooda busy ni?' or 'Avuna kani?' |
| Vammo | Idi fix, weekend ki plan chesta le. | 4 | The reply 'Idi fix, weekend ki plan chesta le' is somewhat informal but contains a Hindi word 'weekend' which breaks the tanglish authenticity. |
| Office lo unna | Work load full ga undi ra. | 6 | Bot reply is casual and natural, but has a slight stiffness and directness, which is typical of Tanglish usage |
| Ekkada unnav | House lo unna, tv chuste unta. | 9 | Perfect casual conversation, but could be even more typical and authentic like 'House lo unte unna, nee tv chusinanta' which is a typical Tanglish expression. |
| Party eppudu | Ekkada ra, weekend ki plan chesta. | 7 | Almost perfect casual Tanglish, only needs a bit more Telugu idiomatic expression for authenticity. |
| Bayam ga undi | Andaru kooda vasthara, le? | 8 | casual and conversational, but a hint of formal phrasing in the grammar |
| Andam ga unnav | Idi emo, coffee kada le. | 8 | Close to a casual conversation, but 'Idi emo' could be more colloquial like 'Ey, emo' |
| Sorry | Sari, sari, tappu ledu ra. | 8 | Good usage of colloquial Telugu, but could be more informal for native-like authenticity |
| Evadi meeda kopam | Adi kuda chudale, nuvu cool ga undu mowa. | 8 | The reply captures a casual and familiar tone, but the phrase 'mowa' might seem slightly unnatural in this context, and a more authentic friend would say something like 'mee cool ga undi' instead of 'mowe' |
| Trip veldama | Ekkada poi trip chesko ra, plan cheyali mowa. | 7 | Casual tone, uses colloquial 'poina', but 'plan cheyali mowa' sounds slightly formal |
| Movie ela undi | Superb ga undi ra, yesterday chusenu, really entha bagundo cheptha. | 8 | Natural use of Telugu verbs ('undi ra'), casual expressions ('superb ga') and informal sentence structure, but could be slightly more authentic with a local flavor and dialect. |
| Status chudu | Chusaa, online unna, ra. | 9 | Natural conversation tone and colloquial expressions like 'Chusaa' and 'online unna' |
| College ki velava | Laptop, chargers, notes, and all anta pack chesko, ippudu start le. | 8 | uses casual language, colloquial expressions like 'antha pack chesko', but slightly forced tone |
